<H2>DVDTS: DVD Decoder Card Driver</A></H2>
<H3>SUMMARY</H3>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2><P>DVD is a trademarked name owned by the DVD Consortium.
DVD provides digital data storage that encompasses audio, video, and computer data.
Microsoft supports DVD in the following ways: </P>
<B><P>Support for DVD movie playback.</B> The DVD Consortium has defined two major
 compression technologies to be used in storing video and audio on a DVD disc, MPEG2,
  and AC-3. Support for these is the primary focus of this sample minidriver.</P>
<B><P>Support for DVD as a storage device.</B> Microsoft DVD-ROM read-only device support,
including support for the Universal Disc Format (UDF) version 1.01, is provided through
installable file system drivers. This aspect of DVD technology is completely independent
 of movie playback, side-stepping copyright protection and other such issues.
 Future DVD standards will allow for recordable devices, opening a wider range of options.
 As indicated in the following diagram, the OEM minidriver documented in this article is used
 only for AC-3 video and MPEG2 video support; UDF support is provided by Microsoft.</P>
<P>The diagram shows the complete support for existing DVD technologies under Microsoft&reg;
 Windows&reg; and Windows NT&reg;. The white boxes represent software supplied by Microsoft,
  while the shaded components are provided by hardware vendors. The ovals represent hardware
  supplied by independent hardware vendors (IHVs) and OEMs. On most PCs with Microsoft DVD
   support, DVD works as a storage device and, if the proper decoding hardware is present,
    supports full DVD-video playback.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><P><IMG SRC="dvdts.gif" WIDTH=567 HEIGHT=437></P>
<B><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2><P>Note:</B> Some components in this architecture will change
 based on advances in other hardware technologies, such as the advent of accelerated graphics
  port (AGP) or improvements in the PCI bus. The only components that will always be present
  are the DVD-ROM driver, the UDF file system, and the DVD Splitter/Navigator.</P>
<P>The sample this article explores, <B>DvdTs.sys</B>, is an example of a real OEM minidriver
(as indicated in the gray Minidriver box in the above diagram) for a Toshiba&reg; DVD decoder
card. The sample includes an .inf file that installs <B>DvdTs.sys</B> to replace
the core <B>TosDvd.sys</B> files in Windows 98 and Windows 2000 (<B>DvdTs.sys</B>
 is functionally equivalent to <B>TosDvd.sys</B>). At the time of this writing,
 some DVD movie
  copy protection support was not yet fully implemented in Windows 2000.</P>
<B><P>DvdTs</B> demonstrates the use of WDM Kernel Streaming services to support
high-performance video/audio playback. A low-level Toshiba proprietary decoder
hardware support library, <B>DvdTDCod.lib,</B> is supplied with the DDK in binary form only,
 but Toshiba has permitted us to publish all the source code that demonstrates the
 architecture of an OEM MPEG2/AC-3 DVD minidriver and its interaction with Microsoft
 kernel streaming services.</P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana"><H3>BUILDING THE SAMPLE</H3>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2><P>The sample is built with the standard DDK BUILD
utility in the standard checked or free DDK build environment. The Sources file links
 to a special library,<B> DvdTDCod.lib</B>, supplied with the DDK in binary form only,
  that encapsulates Toshiba proprietary decoder hardware-specific register definitions
   and low-level support routines. These would vary with each OEM's hardware.</P>
<P>An installation file, <B>DvdTs.inf</B>, is provided. DvdTs.sys may be installed by
creating an OEM Installation Directory containing the DvdTs.sys binary and DvdTs.inf.
On machines with Toshiba DVD players, Windows 98 or Windows 2000 will have
already installed the default core OS driver, TosDvd.sys. Simply go into Device
Manager properties for Toshiba DVD Decoder Card Driver, hit the <B>Update Driver</B> button, and then specify your install directory containing DvdTs.inf and DvdTs.sys.</P>
<P>The DvdTs.sample is completely contained in one directory. There is no special
 test application; just install the new driver and start watching a movie. Note that
  DvdTs will only be started for DVD playback; if a standard CD-ROM or audio CD is
  put in the DVD drive, DvdTs (or TosDvd in the default OS environment) will <I>not</I> be
   started; a different minidriver module for CD-ROM or audio will be loaded by the OS.</P>

</FONT><H3>Programming Tour</H3>
<FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2><P>
WDM streaming enables more efficient data streaming by requiring
fewer transitions between user and kernel modes. In this sample, all streaming is in kernel mode,
the source is a DVD disk,
the video decoder is MPEG2, and the audio  decoder is either MPEG audio, AC-3, or nonexistent
 if the disk contains PCM audio.
  </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. </P>
  
</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2><P>
Video data from a DVD disk is accessed via the
 UDF file system on command from the ActiveMovie file reader. The DVD stream is then
 split into its components, and the MPEG video data is routed to an ActiveMovie
 decoding filter. The data is then sent to hardware via a streaming WDM class driver
  miniport specific to the MPEG video decoding hardware. The output of the decoding
  hardware is sent directly to the frame buffer of the graphics card via a streaming
  WDM interface using the Video Port extensions of Microsoft DirectDraw&reg;.
  </P>
  
<P>The configuration for audio decoding is basically the same.
 AC-3 audio is split out by the DVD splitter and then passed to AC-3 decoder hardware
 via a streaming WDM miniport of the AC-3 class driver. The output of the hardware
  decoder (multichannel audio) is passed to a WDM streaming driver for the audio card.
  The transport for the data movement is decided on by the WDM mechanism.
  This particular driver is not even loaded by the OS for standard audio or data CD playback.
  You will not see DvdTs activated until a DVD disk is inserted in the drive.
  </P>
  
<P>The Toshiba decoder card is a multifunction card with both video and audio decoding on the same physical card.

At run time, a stream is a set of entry points into the driver that can receive or return sequential
 packets of related data. For example, a DVD driver might have the following streams: video
  in, video out, audio in, audio out, subpicture in, close captioning out. If the driver were
   viewed as a component in a data flow diagram, each stream would correspond to a data line
    going into or coming out of the driver.</P>
<P>A driver supports a fixed number of streams. At run time, the system can ask the driver
to instantiate any of its streams. Theoretically, a driver can allow the system to instantiate
 a stream more than once, if the hardware is capable of handling multiple parallel streams of
 that type of data. However, most current DVD decoders can only support one instance of each
  stream. When a stream is opened, some structures are created to represent the stream.
  Pointers to these structures are then passed around between the driver and the system,
   so that the driver code knows which stream it is being executed for.</P>

<B>DriverEntry()</B> is the initial entry point into the driver called by the I/O subsystem. 
A stream class client minidriver's DriverEntry() routine has two main functions to perform: <br>
<br> <B>1)</B> Allocate and fully initialize a <B>HW_INITIALIZATION_DATA </B> structure, and
<br><B> 2)</B> call
 <B>StreamClassRegisterDriver() </B>with that structure and the DriverObject and RegistryPath
  passed into DriverEntry() as input parameters . <br><br>
  The following is a description of the fields in HW_INITIALIZATION_DATA  
that must be filled out. All others not used must be zero-initialized. <P>


 The first group are entry points for the mini Driver.  All entry routines will be called
 at High priority.  If the driver has a task that requires a large amount
 of time to accomplish (e.g. double buffer copying of large amounts of
 data) The driver should request a callback at lower priority to perform the
 desired function.  Synchronization and re-entrancy issues are discussed later.  

 <p> The <B>HwInterrupt</B> field is set to the minidriver's main interrupt service routine.
 If there is no such routine, the field must be set to NULL.
  </p>

<P><PRE><FONT FACE="Courier">
        HwInitData.HwInterrupt = (PHW_INTERRUPT)HwInterrupt;  // ISR  routine
 </FONT></PRE></P>

 The <B>HwReceivePacket</B> field describes the entry point for receiving an SRB
 Request from the stream class driver that is a request to the adapter, as
 opposed to the stream based request handlers that are initialised in the
 OpenStream function

<P><PRE><FONT FACE="Courier">
        HwInitData.HwReceivePacket = AdapterReceivePacket;
</FONT></PRE></P>

<B>AdapterReceivePacket()</B> is the main entry point used by the system to communicate with the driver after it is initialized. 
When the system calls AdapterReceivePacket(), it passes it a pointer to an SRB (stream request block)
 structure. This structure (full name: <B>HW_STREAM_REQUEST_BLOCK</B>) is defined in strmini.h and
 contains information that tells the driver what is being requested. One of the members is an
 integer SRB ID, which tells the driver what type of request this is. 
Some of the many SRB request types are described below.

<P>&#9;<B>SRB_INITIALIZE_DEVICE</B> – The system is asking the driver to initialize its hardware
.</P>
<P>&#9;<B>SRB_UNINITIALIZE_DEVICE </B>– The system is asking the driver to uninitialize
its hardware.</P>
<P>&#9;<B>SRB_GET_STREAM_INFO</B> – The system is asking the driver to fill a supplied
 buffer with information about all the streams it supports. The buffer is essentially
  an array of HW_STREAM_INFORMATION structures (also defined in strmini.h),
   one for each stream. The HW_STREAM_INFORMATION structure contains pointers to other 
structures (declared statically in the driver) that provide more information
about the stream, such as stream property set, etcetera.</P>
<P>&#9;<B>SRB_OPEN_STREAM</B> – The system is asking the driver to instantiate
one of its streams. Another member of the SRB structure specifies the stream number.
Similarly to DriverEntry(), the handler of SRB_OPEN_STREAM must fill a supplied buffer
 with some information and a few function pointers to functions that will handle the
 stream.</P>
<P>&#9;<B>SRB_CLOSE_STREAM</B> – The system is asking the driver to close a stream.
 The structures associated with the stream are destroyed after this call completes.</P>
<P>&#9;</P>

 The <B>HwCancelPacket</B> entry is used to cancel any packet the minidriver may
 currently have outstanding.  This could be a stream, or an adapter based
 request.  This routine will only be called under extreme circumstances, when
 an upper layer is attempting to recover and packets are considered lost.

<P><PRE><FONT FACE="Courier">
        HwInitData.HwCancelPacket = AdapterCancelPacket;
</FONT></PRE></P>

 The <B>HwRequestTimeoutHandler</B> entry is used when a packet times out.  Again,
 This could be a packet for the device, or a stream based packet.  This is
 not necessarily an error, and it is up to the  minidriver to determine what
 to do with the packet that has timed out.

<P><PRE><FONT FACE="Courier">
        HwInitData.HwRequestTimeoutHandler = AdapterTimeoutPacket;
</FONT></PRE></P>


 <p>Next we must define for the class driver the sizes for data structure extensions
 defined by this driver in dvdinit.h.</p>

 The <B>DeviceExtensionSize</B> member specifies the size in bytes required by
 the adapter minidriver for its device extension. This storage is used by
  the adapter minidriver to hold per-adapter information. A pointer to this
  storage is supplied with every call to the adapter minidriver. 
 
<P><PRE><FONT FACE="Courier">
        HwInitData.DeviceExtensionSize = sizeof(HW_DEVICE_EXTENSION);
</FONT></PRE></P>

 <B>PerRequestExtensionSize</B> specifies the number of bytes of extra workspace needed
  for each request by the minidriver. The stream class will allocate whatever extension
   size is requested here. 

<P><PRE><FONT FACE="Courier">
        HwInitData.PerRequestExtensionSize = sizeof(SRB_EXTENSION);
</FONT></PRE></P>

<B>PerStreamExtensionSize</B> specifies the number of bytes of extra workspace needed
 for each stream information structure by the minidriver. Whenever a new stream is opened,
  the stream class will allocate whatever extension size is specified in this member. 

<P><PRE><FONT FACE="Courier">
        HwInitData.PerStreamExtensionSize = sizeof(STREAMEX);
</FONT></PRE></P>

<B>FilterInstanceExtensionSize</B> is the number of bytes of workspace needed for each instance extension.
Usually set to zero except for hardware that can support multiple instances of the reported
streams on the same adapter. This is not supported in this case.
 		
 <P><PRE><FONT FACE="Courier">
        HwInitData.FilterInstanceExtensionSize = 0;
</FONT></PRE></P>


 The <B>BusMasterDMA</B> field indicates to the system that the memory pointers passed
 in to the mini driver in the data packets may be used for direct Bus Master DMA
 access.  If the mini driver uses a translation buffer (to ensure minimum DMA
 size, or correct buffer alignment), this BOOLEAN should be set to FALSE.

 <P><PRE><FONT FACE="Courier">
	HwInitData.BusMasterDMA = TRUE;
</FONT></PRE></P>


 The <B>Dma24BitAddresses</B> field indicates a device that uses DMA that only can
 access the lower 24bits of the 32 bit address space.  Again, this should only
 be set to true if the minidriver is going to be doing DMA directly to the buffer
 passed in the data packets, and not through a double buffer scenario.

 <P><PRE><FONT FACE="Courier">
	HwInitData.Dma24BitAddresses = FALSE;
	HwInitData.BufferAlignment = 4;
</FONT></PRE></P>


 If the <B>TurnOffSynchronization</B> field is set to FALSE, the mini driver may never
 be re-entered. Under these conditions, if the mini-driver uses a DISPATCH or lower priority
 callback routine, the miniDriver must disable any interrupts that it might
 receive.  If an interrupt controlled by the driver is received while code in
 the mini driver is running at DISPATCH or lower priority, the interrupt will
 be LOST.  If an interrupt is received while at HIGH priority, it will be queued
 until the code in the driver is finished.
 If the TurnOffSynchronization field is set to TRUE, the mini-driver must be
 fully capable of handling multi-processor and single processor re-entrancy

 <P><PRE><FONT FACE="Courier">
	HwInitData.TurnOffSynchronization = FALSE;
</FONT></PRE></P>


 The <B>DmaBufferSize</B> specifies the size of the single contiguous region of
 physical memory that the driver needs at hardware intialization time.  The
 memory will be returned to the driver when the driver makes the
 StreamClassGetDmaBuffer call.  It is important to use as little physical
 buffer as possible here, as this will be locked physical memory that is
 unavailable to the sytem, even when the streaming class mini driver is not
 in use.

 <P><PRE><FONT FACE="Courier">
	HwInitData.DmaBufferSize = DMASIZE;
</FONT></PRE></P>

    
     Finally, DriverEntry() must attempt to register with the streaming class driver,
	 passing on the DriverObject and RegistryPath parms as well as a pointer to
	 the fully initialized <B>HW_INITIALIZATION_DATA </B> structure
	 
 <P><PRE><FONT FACE="Courier">
 	ntStatus = (
		StreamClassRegisterMinidriver(
			(PVOID)DriverObject,
			(PVOID)RegistryPath,
			&HwInitData )
	);
</FONT></PRE></P>

	<B> Note,</B> this will result in calls to our own driver-defined hardware initialization routines.
	 This occurs when StreamClassRegisterMinidriver() makes a call to our driver's
AdapterReceivePacket() routine with a stream request type of <B>SRB_INITIALIZE_DEVICE</B>.
Before completing initialization,  the driver must obtain and save some PCI configuration
space information,and this cannot be done at elevated IRQL, so the stream class API
 <B>StreamClassCallAtNewPriority()</B> is used to schedule a low priority callback to do
 the main work.  Processing will continue when this runs.
 
 <P><PRE><FONT FACE="Courier">
 
        StreamClassCallAtNewPriority(
            NULL,
            pSrb->HwDeviceExtension,
            Low,                                         // priority level to drop to
            (PHW_PRIORITY_ROUTINE) GetPCIConfigSpace,    // driver-defined routine to call while there
            pSrb
            );

</FONT></PRE></P>
    
	In DvdTs, the GetPCIConfigSpace() function, besides calling <B>StreamClassReadWriteConfig()</B>
	to save needed PCI configuration information also in turn makes another call to
	StreamClassCallAtNewPriority(), this time requesting a boost back to high priority for the
	 rest of hardware initialization to proceed.
	 
 <P><PRE><FONT FACE="Courier">
	
        StreamClassCallAtNewPriority(
            NULL,
            pSrb->HwDeviceExtension,
            LowToHigh,                                  // priority level to raise to
            (PHW_PRIORITY_ROUTINE) InitializationEntry, // driver-defined routine to call while there
            pSrb
            );
	
</FONT></PRE></P>
	
StreamClassCallAtNewPriority() is frequently used by stream class minidrivers for synchronization,
 since, as noted earlier,all minidriver entry points are called at high priority.
 The new priorities that can be specified are as follows:


<P><BR><B>High </B>
Priority at which the minidriver's functions are typically called. If the minidriver
 has scheduled a DISPATCH_LEVEL priority call and needs
to return to high priority, this priority should be specified. For example,
if the minidriver has disabled its adapter interrupts and scheduled a DispatchPriority
event, the minidriver should schedule a HighPriority event from the DispatchPriority event,
 and re-enable card interrupts when the specified HighPriority entry point is called.
 Doing so will avoid reentrancy in the minidriver. 
<P><BR><B>Dispatch</B> 
Priority used to specify when additional processing will take less than 1 millisecond.
 The adapter should not interrupt after this notification call is made, so interrupts
 should be disabled on the card before specifying this call, or the minidriver's ISR
  will be re-entered. If the ISR was coded to be reentrant with the Dispatch routine,
  this condition is acceptable, as long as the ISR does not call any stream class services. 
<P><BR><B>Low</B> 
Priority used to specify when additional processing will take more than 1 millisecond.
The adapter should not interrupt after this notification call is made, so interrupts
should be disabled on the card before specifying this call, or the minidriver's ISR
 will be re-entered. Additionally, any of the minidriver's request functions and any
 scheduled timers will re-enter the minidriver when this priority is scheduled. 
<B>Note</B>  If the minidriver has left synchronization enabled
 (the TurnOffSynchronization boolean in the HW_INITIALIZATION_DATA structure was set to FALSE)
 no stream class driver services can be called by a low priority thread except from
 StreamClassCallAtNewPriority with LowToHigh. 

<P><BR><B>LowToHigh </B>
Priority used to allow a thread called at low priority to return to high priority,
so other stream class driver services can be called. 

<H3>Header Definition Tour</H3>

For a stream class minidriver, the static definitions in the mindriver's stream definition
header
 file ( in this sample it is <B>strmid.h</B> )  are as important ( and sometimes nearly as
  large in size! ) as the supporting code.

DVD minidrivers support both input and output data streams.
Streams are uniquely defined by three GUIDs (major type, minor type, and specifier)
and a format block. Stream formats are also referred to as media types. See DirectShow™
in the Platform SDK, Graphics and Multimedia Services, DirectX Media SDK directories,
and the Kernel-Mode Streaming Reference for more information on media types and format blocks.

The reader is strongly encouranged to closely examine strmid.h to see how four key concepts 
are used to build a substantial static definition of exactly how the adapter serviced by this
minidriver behaves, allowing most of the coding details to be handled by the stream class driver.
 <br><br>
 <B>1) Data Formats</B>, identified by <B>KSDATAFORMAT</B> structures in strmid.h,
for example:
 <P><PRE><FONT FACE="Courier">
/*
 Define the Mpeg2Video format that the minidriver supports
 */
KSDATAFORMAT hwfmtiMpeg2Vid
     = {
	sizeof (KSDATAFORMAT),
	0, //flags, not used here
	0, //sample size, not used here
	0, // reserved
	//
	// specify media type, subtype, and format from mpeg2 video
	//
    STATIC_KSDATAFORMAT_TYPE_DVD_ENCRYPTED_PACK,
	STATIC_KSDATAFORMAT_SUBTYPE_MPEG2_VIDEO,
	STATIC_KSDATAFORMAT_SPECIFIER_MPEG2_VIDEO
	};
</FONT></PRE></P>

In Dvdts, analogous structures are defined for AC3 audio and LCPM audio, Sub Picture format,
Close Caption format, Video Port Extensions (VPE),  as well as MPEG2 Video. See strmid.h.
<br> <br>

 <B>2) Property Sets</B>, identified by <B>KSPROPERTY_ITEM</B> structures 
 built up into  <B>KSPROPERTY_SET</B>arrays  in strmid.h, for example:
 
 <br> <br>

 <P><PRE><FONT FACE="Courier">
// Video

static const KSPROPERTY_ITEM mpegVidPropItm[]={
	{KSPROPERTY_DVDSUBPIC_PALETTE,
	FALSE,

	}};

// Audio

        (PFNKSHANDLER) TRUE,    // get available modes is supported
        sizeof(KSPROPERTY),
        sizeof(ULONG),          // minimum size of data requested
        (PFNKSHANDLER) FALSE,   // set available modes is not supported
        NULL,
        0,
        NULL,

	NULL,
	0,
	NULL,
	NULL,

	},
	.
	.
	.

The above appear later in strmid.h as members of property set arrays, e.g.:

 <P><PRE><FONT FACE="Courier">
static /* const*/ KSPROPERTY_SET mpegVidPropSet[] = {
	{
		&KSPROPSETID_Mpeg2Vid,

		(PKSPROPERTY_ITEM)RateChangePropItm
	},
	.
	.

};

In the WDM Streaming architecture, a filter is a kernel-mode driver, such as DvdTs, that can be
 associated with a piece of hardware, though this is not a requirement. Each filter's
  capability is partly described by a number of connection points called pins. Each pin
  can consume, produce, or both consume and produce a data stream. More specialized tasks
   can be accomplished by connecting several filters together using these pins. For example,
    a series of filters could be connected to play filtered and mixed audio.
The characteristics of a pin or a filter are described by property sets.
These sets can describe, for example, the number of connections available,
 the type of data required, and in which direction the data flows.
The WDM Streaming architecture also provides mechanisms for controlling and querying
filters by clients or other filters. These mechanisms include, for example, retrieving
the volume level of an audio filter or starting playback of a video stream. Specific
implementations of these mechanisms, such as an interface for passing coefficients to
a low-pass audio filter, are also provided.

<B> 4) Event Sets</B><BR> describing important transitions, notifications, and clock events,
built up of various <B>KSEVENT_ITEM</B> structs into <B>KSEVENT_SET</B> arrays.
An event set for a particular minidriver is a uniquely identified set that represents
 a group of items about which a client, such as the user mode Dvd player application, can be notified.
