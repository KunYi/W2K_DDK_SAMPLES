Microsoft Windows 95 Compatible Device IDs
    for Plug and Play Modems

Version 1.0 / August 4, 1995
Copyright (c) 1995 Microsoft Corporation

This document specifies compatible device IDs for Plug and Play
internal (ISA) and external (RS-232) modems designed for Microsoft
Windows 95.  These IDs are not intended for use with other bus
or connector types, e.g. PCMCIA, parallel port, etc.

Plug and Play modems should report appropriate compatible IDs so
that Windows 95 can install and use a default driver in the event 
that the regular manufacturer-supplied install disk and INF file 
are not available.

NOTE:  Compatible IDs are not intended to replace actual tested
       Windows 95 install disks with INF files. 

       Do not use compatible ID for main device IDs.
       Rather, modems must have device IDs unique to manufacturer
       and product, as specified in the specifications for ISA and 
       RS-232 Plug and Play devices.

To use the table below, match modems to the appropriate row
based on Bus type, Commands, and Max DCE speed.  Then, select 
ONE of the compatible IDs, depending on whether or not the 
modem supports VoiceView.

Commands:  Select an "Enhanced" ID if the modem supports the
           following commands as described.  Most importantly,
           the modem must never return "ERROR" in response to
           any of these commands.

    L0/L2/L3        - Adjust speaker volume

    M0/M1/M2/M3     - Set speaker mode

    X3/X4           - Disable/enable dial tone detection

    ;               - Allows dial strings to be split, without
                      dial tone detection on subsequent ATD commands.
                      Test this against very long dial strings, e.g.
                      long distance credit card numbers, etc.
                      
Max DCE:  "Any" means that Windows 95 will set the port (DTE)
          speed to 9600 bps by default, and assume maximum
          DTE and DCE rates of 115200 bps.  Use "Any" for
          modems that have non-standard maximum bps DCE rates,
          such as 33600 bps.

IMPORTANT:  The basic send and receive portions of the Modem
Compatibility Tests (MCTs) included in the Windows 95 Device
Driver Kit (DDK) must be able to pass for a modem installed 
using a compatible ID.  Also, Windows 95 programs such as
HyperTerminal, The Microsoft Network (MSN), Dial-Up Networking,
and Phone Dialer must be able to make connections in this
configuration.  If any of these tests fail, then the modem is
*not* compatible with the selected ID, and should not be reported
as such.  Similarly, VoiceView features should be thoroughly
tested on modems which report a VoiceView compatible ID.
