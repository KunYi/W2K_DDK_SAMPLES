This sample demonstrates how a Windows NT driver can utilize the HAL 
interfaces to read the Intel Machine Check Architecture (MCA) registers OR 
get notified asynchronously when a Machine Check Exception occurs.

This sample is composed of two parts - a Windows NT kernel-mode device driver 
(IMCA.SYS) and a Win32 test application (MCALOG.EXE).
